**backends**

| backend | effective | device buffers | placement | prefill tok/s (p50) | decision ms (p50) | load ms (p50) | decision tok/s (p50) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| cpu | cpu | CPU=3 | n_gpu_layers=0 | 49.355 | 1,877.274 | 2,014.429 | 4.261 |
| vulkan | vulkan | Vulkan0=3 · Vulkan_Host=3 | n_gpu_layers=-1 | 3.095 | 714.367 | 2,535.462 | 11.199 |
| cuda | — | — | not measured | — | — | — | no local llama.cpp bundle carries libggml-cuda.so (benchmarks never download one: run `ggufone init --backend cuda` or point GGUFONE_BENCH_RUNTIME_DIR at extracted bundles) |

- one bundle per process: `--backend all` selected cpu, vulkan, cuda over 2 distinct local bundle directories, and two distinct local bundles cannot be dlopened into one process: the second bundle's libllama/libggml are shadowed by the first one's SONAMEs (RTLD_GLOBAL, identical names) and the process aborts at teardown with `double free or corruption` — exit 134 (card t_dd62ec29). Every row was measured by its own child process — the documented `--backend <one>` path — and carries the `process` block that produced it; a child whose answer the parent could not verify leaves no row at all.
